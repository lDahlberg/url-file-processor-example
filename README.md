# Quick Start

## Introduction
This service processes urls generated by a URL processor service. In order to do so, it reads files
and submits the URLs found therein as HTTP requests and then counts their successes or failures

## To Run
From the terminal, navigate to the root directory of the url-file-processor and use the command
UNIX / POSIX
`./mvnw spring-boot:run`

Windows:
`mvnw spring-boot:run`

If you are using an IDE, set up a Spring Boot profile and set the default class to:

`UrlFileProcessorApplication`

After the service is started, it will begin to process files and generate its output every 15 seconds.
